# Product Landing Page with Toggle Interaction

This project is a responsive product landing page built with HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.

The main goal of this project is to practice front-end fundamentals, focusing on semantic structure, layout organization and basic state control using JavaScript.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive layout using Flexbox
- Clean and organized CSS
- Toggle interaction to show and hide content
- State control handled via CSS classes
- Basic accessibility support using ARIA attributes
- Clear separation between structure (HTML), presentation (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript)

## JavaScript Logic
The JavaScript controls a simple toggle interaction.
When the user clicks the button, the script checks the current state of the content and updates it by adding or removing a CSS class.
This approach avoids inline styles and keeps the code scalable and easier to maintain.

## Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to understand how JavaScript can control UI state without directly manipulating styles.
The focus is on writing predictable, readable and maintainable code, following front-end best practices.
